section of P8105.

## Problem 1

### Creation of data frame

The code chunk below involves the creation of a data frame with various
types of variables.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

    ## ✓ ggplot2 3.3.0     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
    ## ✓ tibble  3.0.1     ✓ dplyr   0.8.5
    ## ✓ tidyr   1.1.0     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
    ## ✓ readr   1.3.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.0

    ## ── Conflicts ────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

``` r
prob_one_df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_char = c("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", "today"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("the", "the", "the", "fuzzy", "fuzzy", "fuzzy", "cat", "cat", "cat", "cat")),
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
)
```

### Calculation of means

The means for each variable in the data frame are calculated below.

``` r
mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_norm))
```

    ## [1] 0.1638629

``` r
mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob_one_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

The mean cannot be computed for the character and factor vectors, as
they do not take on numerical values, which explains the occurrence of
the above warnings. The mean was computed for the logical variable,
although it likely should not have been computed as it relates instead
to the number of “true” responses.

### Variable conversions

This code chunk converts variables from one type to another.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical))
```

    ##  [1] 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_factor))
```

    ##  [1] 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 1

The above conversions explain some of the findings from the mean
calculations. Firstly, the numeric conversion demonstrates that R is
reading the logical vector as a binary (0, 1) which explains why the
mean was computed. The character variable cannot be converted to
numeric. When converting the factor to numeric, it is converted as the
three levels of the variable.

The next code chunk does additional variable conversions.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical)) * (pull(prob_one_df, vec_norm))
```

    ##  [1] 0.0000000 1.0857424 2.0899128 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 1.2756140
    ##  [8] 0.0000000 0.6655918 0.7728991

``` r
as.factor(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical)) * (pull(prob_one_df, vec_norm))
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical)),
    ## (pull(prob_one_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
fact_of_log = as.factor(pull(prob_one_df, vec_logical))
fact_num_by_random = as.numeric(fact_of_log) * (pull(prob_one_df, vec_norm))
fact_num_by_random
```

    ##  [1] -1.0774798  2.1714848  4.1798257 -0.9549159 -0.7388230 -0.8814841
    ##  [7]  2.5512280 -0.5984282  1.3311837  1.5457981

The warning above occurring for the fact\_log\_random variable is due to
an attempt to multiply a non-numeric variable by a numeric variable.

## Problem 2

### Descriptive Statistics

The code chunk below is designed to call the correct package.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The penguins data set includes variables species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year. It has 344 rows and 8 columns.

The **species** variable is a factor variable. This factor variable
includes levels Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo: 152 observations are
classified as Adelie, 68 as Chinstrap and 124 as Gentoo. There are 0
missing values for this variable.

The **island** variable is a factor variable. This factor variable
includes levels Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen: 168 observations are
classified as Biscoe, 124 as Dream and 52 as Torgersen. There are 0
missing values for this variable.

The **bill length** variable is a numeric variable. The mean bill length
is 43.9219298 with a standard deviation of 5.4595837; the median is
44.45 and interquartile (IQR) range of 9.275. There are 2 missing values
for this variable.

The **bill depth** variable is a numeric variable. The mean bill length
is 17.1511696 with a standard deviation of 1.9747932; the median is 17.3
and interquartile (IQR) range of 3.1. There are 2 missing values for
this variable.

The **flipper length** variable is a integer variable. The mean bill
length is 200.9152047 with a standard deviation of 14.0617137; the
median is 197 and interquartile (IQR) range of 23. There are 2 missing
values for this variable.

The **body mass** variable is a integer variable. The mean bill length
is 4201.754386 with a standard deviation of 801.9545357; the median is
4050 and interquartile (IQR) range of 1200. There are 2 missing values
for this variable.

The **sex** variable is a factor variable. This factor variable includes
levels female, male: NA observations are classified as male and NA as
female. The number of missing observations for this variable is 11.
There are 11 missing values for this variable.

The **year** variable is a integer variable, with 344 observations. The
year variable has a minimum of 2007 and a maximum of 2009. There are 0
missing values for this variable.

### Plot

The code chunk below creates a plot of bill length (x) and flipper
length (y). Species are denoted with different colors.

``` r
# The library call below is purely for aesthetic reasons, to be able to alter the colors in the plot.

library(wesanderson)

fliper_length_plot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point()

fliper_length_plot + scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette( n = 3, name = "Moonrise2"))
```

``` r
# The code below is to save the scatterplot.

ggsave("flipper_length_plot.png")
```
