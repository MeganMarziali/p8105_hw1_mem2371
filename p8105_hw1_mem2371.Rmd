# Problem 1

Problem one involves the creation of a data frame with various types of variables.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

prob_one_df = tibble(
  vec_norm = rnorm(10),
  vec_char = c("the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumped", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", "today"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("the", "the", "the", "fuzzy", "fuzzy", "fuzzy", "cat", "cat", "cat", "cat")),
  # Denotes whether values in this data frame are greater than 0 or not
  vec_logical = vec_norm > 0,
)

mean(prob_one_df[["vec_norm"]])
mean(prob_one_df[["vec_char"]])
mean(prob_one_df[["vec_factor"]])
mean(prob_one_df[["vec_logical"]])
```

The mean cannot be computed for the character and factor vectors, as they do not take on numerical values.
